This project is spun off of the very cool project MaterialDrawer, generously shared by Mike Penz
https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer


I chose not to fork this because I'm using the MiniDrawer as a starting point for something other than actually enhancing the existing MaterialDrawer project.  Therefore, while many elements of the original project remain in the code base - you can see that those that are not used will be shifted over into folders clearly indicating those files are out of play.
